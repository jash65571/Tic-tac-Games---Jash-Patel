ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

In this project, I created a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides an interactive experience where players can compete against each other or against the computer.

Key Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Players can click on the grid to make their moves, with the game automatically alternating between player turns.
Versatile Options: Users can choose to play as either "X" or "O" and select the difficulty level of the computer opponent.
Responsive Design: The game interface is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Visual Feedback: Winning moves and tie games are visually highlighted on the grid, enhancing the user experience and providing clear feedback.
Celebratory Animations: Upon winning, players are greeted with a celebratory animation, adding an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay.
Project Aim:
The aim of this project was to develop a fun and intuitive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game while showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development technologies. By incorporating responsive design principles and interactive features, the project aims to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience for users of all ages.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: for structuring the game layout and user interface.
CSS3: for styling the game elements and creating visual effects.
JavaScript: for implementing game logic, user interactions, and dynamic behavior.
Git: for version control and project management.
Future Enhancements:
While the current version of the game offers a satisfying gaming experience, future enhancements could include:

Implementing an unbeatable AI algorithm using the minimax algorithm.
Adding multiplayer functionality to allow users to play against friends online.
Integrating sound effects and background music to further enhance immersion.
Enhancing accessibility features to ensure inclusivity for all users.
